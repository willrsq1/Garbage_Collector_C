Upon calling, ft_calloc will :
Secures ALL Mallocs.
Initializes ALL Malloced bits to '\0'.
Stores everything that has been Malloced in a chained list.

Upon calling, "ft_free_everything_lol" frees everything that has been previously Malloced.
Upon calling, "ft_free_this_data" frees the given data.

A main is available to try and see how to use it.

Is user-error proof.

Enjoy !
