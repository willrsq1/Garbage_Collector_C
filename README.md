"ft_calloc" :
Secures ALL Mallocs.
Initializes ALL Malloced bits to '\0'.
Stores everything that has been Malloced in a chained list.

"ft_free_everything_lol" frees everything that has been previously Malloced.

"ft_free_this_data" frees the given data.

A main is available to try and see how to use it.

Replace the Gargage struct by any struct of your own that stores the address of the first list of the chain !

Enjoy !
